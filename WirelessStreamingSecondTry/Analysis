Getting Started

You will need to download the project from moodle platform or via github.

Prerequisites

You will need to have: compiler-drivers of the GNU Compiler Collection like g++ or gcc.

Installing

Go to the directory of the project.

Make an executable of the project with the following command: g++ std=c++11 -o executable main.cpp

Now run the executable: ./executable

Now there's an "infinite" loop and you can run the program as many as you like. You can exit the loop by typing every key excluding [1,2,3,4].

If you type 1 : you will see the analyze of: Internet Speed 6Mbps and Variable Buffer Size
If you type 2 : you will see the analyze of: Internet Speed 11Mbps and 50 Buffer Size
If you type 3 : you will see the analyze of: Internet Speed 30Mbps and 50 Buffer Size
If you type 4 : you will see the analyze of: Internet Speed 54Mbps and 50 Buffer Size

Analysis of every configuration:

1. Internet speed 6Mbps, Buffer size from 0->300 Mbps

I have also attached a graphic with this information.
From my point of view, if you choose a buffer size of 50 in this case everything will work
just fine because the packets loss will be around 13%.


2. Internet speed 11Mbps, Buffer Size 50


Buffer size: 50 packets
Wireless speed: 11000000 bps
Packets lost = 19665
Packets done = 669844
Lost traffic = 2.8520%
Average delay = 0.0146 s


3. Internet speed 30Mbps, Buffer Size 50

For 689509 packets:
Buffer size: 50 packets
Wireless speed: 30000000 bps
Packets lost = 3336
Packets done = 686173
Lost traffic = 0.4838%
Average delay = 0.0039 s

4. Internet speed 54Mbps, Buffer size 50

For 689509 packets:
Buffer size: 50 packets
Wireless speed: 54000000 bps
Packets lost = 185
Packets done = 689324
Lost traffic = 0.0268%
Average delay = 0.0017 s


Taking in consideration the average delay and the lost traffic, from my point of view,
the best "setup" would be an internet speed of 11Mbps and a buffer size of 50.
The lost traffic is around 2% and the average delay is 0.0.146s .
Of course, if we take a look at internet speed 54 mbps, and buffer size of 50 we can
definitely say that is the best setup, but considering that the price is bigger, I think
we can stick with the 11Mbps speed.


Running environment

The simulation was run on my personal laptop. MacOS Operating System.
