Analysis of the probability for each game:

1. "Asso" Game:

The probability of drawing an ace is: 4/52 = 0.07692307692

Explanation:

In the deck there are 4 aces. The total numbers of cards are 52. So we
have to divide our favorable case: drawing one of the aces (4) and divide it
by the numbers of cards 52.

Simulation:

After 1.000.000 (one million) trials we have:
Number of trials: 1000000
Number of wins: 76528
Number of losses: 923472
Estimated probability of winning: 0.076528
Estimated balance of the player: -234720

So the casino is winning with this game: 234720 euros after one million
plays.

2. "Grande" Game:

The probability of this

3. "Cuori" Game:

The probability of drawing one "Hearts" out of three cards is: 13/52= 0.25

Explanation:

In the deck there are 13 hearts cards. The total numbers of cards are 52. So we
have to divide our favorable case: drawing a heart card (13) and
divide it by the numbers of cards 52.

Simulation:

4. "Completare" Game:

The probability of drawing four cards of different suits is:
(52/52)*(39/51)*(26/50)*(13/49) = 685464/6497400 = 0.105498

Explanation:

In the deck there are 52 cards. Each card corresponds to one suit.
So at first draw the probability is 1. Second draw 39/51. We have
"eliminated" the card from the suit that we extracted the first
draw favorable cases(52-13) and the card that we have drawn from the total cases
(52-1).  Third draw: favorable: 39-13 = 26 and total: 51-1 = 50.
Fourth draw: favorable: 26-13 = 13 and total: 50-1 = 49.
So we are multiplying the probabilities above and we obtain = 0.105498

Simulation:

After 1.000.000 (one million) trials we have:
Number of wins: 105481
Number of losses: 894519
Estimated probability of winning: 0.105481
Estimated balance of the player: 1109620

So the casino is winning with this game: -1109620 euros after one million
plays.

5. "George's Game":

!!! In this game, if you win you are receiving 240.000 euros !!!

The probability of drawing 4 aces is:
(4/52)*(3/51)*(2/50)*(1/49) = 0.000003693...

Explanation:

In the deck there are 52 card. There are 4 aces. So at first draw the probability is 4/52.
Second draw 3/51. We have
"eliminated" the ace from the suit that we extracted the first
draw favorable cases(4-1) and the card that we have drawn from the total cases
(52-1).  Third draw: favorable: 3-1 = 2 and total: 51-1 = 50.
Fourth draw: favorable: 2-1 = 1 and total: 50-1 = 49.
So we are multiplying the probabilities above and we obtain = 0.000003693...

Simulation:

After 1.000.000 (one million) trials we have:
Number of trials: 1000000
Number of wins: 4
Number of losses: 999996
Estimated probability of winning: 0.000004
Estimated balance of the player: -40000

So the casino is winning with this game: 40000 euros after one million
plays.
